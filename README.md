# A-Bot-of-Ice-and-Fire

#Kaitlin:
Today, Sinovia and I broke down our project into (seemingly) manageable pieces. We created a Trello to keep track of our work and decided how we should allocate our time.
During lab time, we made headway with getting our input to trigger a response from our bot. By the end of class, we were able to append both user input and bot input to unordered lists.

This evening, we divided the tasks of writing additional JS for some of our other commands.

Specifically, I read through the Giphy API and decided how best to write GET requests to them and wrote JS to append our '@help' menu.
