# A-Bot-of-Ice-and-Fire

#Monday
Today, Sinovia and Kaitlin broke down the Bot build into (seemingly) manageable pieces. They created a Trello to keep track of their work and decided how they should allocate their time.
During lab time, they made headway with getting their input to trigger a response from the bot. By the end of class, they were able to append both user input and bot input to unordered lists.

This evening, they divided the tasks of writing additional JS for some of the other commands.

Specifically, Kaitlin read through the Giphy API and decided how best to write GET requests to them and wrote JS to append our '@help' menu.

#Tuesday
A lot of great headway was made calling API's for the bot. Sinovia and Kaitlin got the @giphy and @song features working, appending content to the page with each call.

Now comes the styling.
